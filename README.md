# hello-world
My first repository on Github
Hi Everyone!

I am Boaz I have been in the programming and computing world for a while now, and someone introduced me to Github and I decided to try it. I have a great passion for technology and I love practically every programming language from Java, Python, C++, C#, Javascript, Flutter, and many more and I like to learn new things always. I am into web development for now and I intend to do more and also explore more fields.
I hope everything goes on well here. Thank you.
